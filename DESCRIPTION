Description: I made this package to help people who want to use R but are a little nervous about calculating doubling times from their growth curves. This shiny app helps take you steps that could be confusing to new R users, like filtering their data, log-transforming their graphs to assess exponential phase, and calculating doubling times from log2-transformed data.
